/* Exercise 38 - Orders - accidental double entry

Janet Leverling, one of the salespeople, has come to you with a request.
She thinks that she accidentally double-entered a line item on an order, with a different ProductID, but the same quantity.
She remembers that the quantity was 60 or more. 
Show all the OrdersIDs with line items that match this, in order of OrdersID.
